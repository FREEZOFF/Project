Welcome to my project.
This project focuses on developing a multi-model AI system to detect neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and other related conditions at early stages.
It combines various types of diagnostic tests like MRI scans, memory games, coordination tests, speech analysis and a Parkinson's detector to provide an integrated detection score.
